o	Developed a natural language processing (NLP) model to predict customer churn based on the textual content of e-commerce product reviews.

o	Fine-tuned the BERT model on a labeled dataset with churn and non-churn classes derived from customer reviews.

o	Trained the model to classify reviews as indicating churn or no churn, aiming to help businesses identify at-risk customers through their feedback

o	Evaluated model performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust classification.

o	Proposed the model as a potential tool for proactive customer retention strategies by monitoring sentiment and indicators of dissatisfaction in product reviews.
